# Questions

Is the improved performance of "[ expression ] && " relative to readability of if statements justified for medium-complexity clauses?  
Is "[ expression ] && " faster than a switch statement?  
Is there a way to implement the functionality of sponge natively in POSIX?  
Does it make sense to:  
    Disable the entry of a timestamp into an existing timer?  
    Presume that entry of a timestamp must be a mistake, and treat it as a duration?  
    Leave the functionality whereby a timer can be modified by a timestamp?
